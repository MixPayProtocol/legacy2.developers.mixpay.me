MixPay is decentralised and supports Mixin Messenger and any on-chain wallet for payments. MixPay is very flexible because of its underlying ability to separate the three parts of the quote, payment and settlement. MixPay supports three settlement modes simultaneously: regular user, robot, and multi-signature group.
