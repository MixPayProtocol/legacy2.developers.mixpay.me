Please do the following to join the group: 



  1. Download [Mixin App](https://mixin.one/messenger)；
  2. Open the Mixin App, set up a Mixin account;
  3. Open this link [MixPay Developers](https://mixin.one/codes/3d713386-e987-4d94-8764-b43e77a8d429), and use the Mixin QRcode scanner (on the bottom center) to scan the QRcode.



Our MixPay product is built on top of the Mixin App; as a developer, you should be familiar with both of these products.
