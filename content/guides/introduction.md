MixPay, Payment for Web3.
:::

MixPay is a decentralized crypto payments service platform built on [Mixin Network](https://developers.mixin.one/docs/introduction).

MixPay is decentralized and supports Mixin Messenger and any on-chain wallet for payments. MixPay is very flexible because of its underlying ability to separate the three parts of quote, payment and settlement. MixPay supports three settlement modes at the same time, normal user, robot, and multi-signature group.

You only need to specify a certain amount of currency to MixPay, the user choose any cryptocurrency to pay, and MixPay converts them automatically. For example, suppose there is a current commodity valued at $10 that needs to be payed, the merchant can choose to charge $10 in BTC or any cryptocurrency, and the user can choose to pay $10 in USDT or any cryptocurrency. And all this can be achieved only by scanning the QR code using [Mixin Messenger](https://mixin.one/messenger) or any on-chain wallets.
