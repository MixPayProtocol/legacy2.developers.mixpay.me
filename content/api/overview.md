MixPay is decentralized and supports Mixin Messenger and any on-chain wallet for payments. MixPay is very flexible because of its underlying ability to separate the three parts of quote, payment and settlement. MixPay supports three settlement modes at the same time, normal user, robot, and multi-signature group.

## Getting Started

You only need to set the amount and currency of the [payment link](https://developers.mixpay.me/api/payments/pay), and MixPay will do the rest.

In addition to this easy way, you can use the MixPay API to build your application in any language.
